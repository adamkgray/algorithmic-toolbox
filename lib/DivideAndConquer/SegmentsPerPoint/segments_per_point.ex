  Given N points on a number line, and M segments on that same number line,
  find the number of segments each point lies within

  The solution to this problem works like this:
  1) Reformat the list of points, reformat the list of segments
  2) Combine these two lists and sort them
  3) Iterate through this sorted list, keeping track of the number of lefts and rights, and where the points occur in between them
  4) The number of segments a point crosses is the minumum of (1) the lefts that come before it minus the rights before it and (2) the rights that come after it
