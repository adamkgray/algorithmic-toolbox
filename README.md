# Algorithmic Toolbox

These are my Elixir solutions (so far) to the problems presented in the Coursera course "Algorithmic Toolbox".

They can be explored freely in mix:

```
iex -S mix
```

The algorithms are also configured to read from stdin and return stdout, like so:

```
$ mix run -e APlusB.main < ./lib/APlusB/input.txt
```
